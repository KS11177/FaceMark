FaceMark leverages machine learning libraries like OpenCV and face_detection to automate the attendance process.
It captures and analyzes facial features in real-time, matching them against a database of registered users. When a face is recognized, 
the system marks attendance by logging the user's information into a CSV file. This efficient solution 
enhances accuracy and reduces manual effort in tracking attendance.
